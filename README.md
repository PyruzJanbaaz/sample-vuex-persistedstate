# sample-vuex-persistedstate
Sometimes we need our VueJS Web App to persist some information in browser local storage. It could be local settings, account info or some tokens. We definitely don’t want to lose them once the page is refreshed.
In this quick example, I’ll show how to use vuex and vuex-persistedstate to make the magic happen.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
